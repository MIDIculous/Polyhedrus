Make sure internal processing is always at 96Khz or more (remove hi quality button)
Need to connect more mod destinations

# Rework and features

For Wavetable osc:
- Add Stepping/Mixing for wave transition within table
- Add a Scan speed
- Scan mode: Repeat, Rewind, One Shot
- Granular osc should have same option

make oscillator interface support stereo.
For FM, use L+R signal as modulator.
Add osc envelopes for each osc
Special oscs should have a second panel for advanced settings
Add an additive osc type with features:
- 16 partials
- waveshape (for each partial - this should be done additively as well, i.e. a saw wave simple adds partials at 2x, 3x, 4x... as well. Limit the number of overtones to 16)
- Bit Depth
- Waveshaper (shapes final, combined wave)
- Waveshaper amount
Add supersaw oscillator
Add 4th oscillator
Add at least one more modulator
Make LFO and Envelope output of modulators available as sources
Add Osc Envelopes
Add FM synthesis section - new tab where the mixer is.
1>1 1>2 1>3 1>4
    2>2 2>3 2>4
        3>3 3>4
            4>4

Make the AM options separate feeds into the mixer
Change the AM to RM (ringmod, bipolar, not unipolar)
re-think mixing between stages (character/HP/LP filter) - would be good to get output straight from each stage
Generalize the oscillator block to allow more types of oscs
Add granular synthesis
Make the editor one-instance only
improve UDP communication so that new plugin instances notify the editor of their existence

# DSP Improvements

Parameter smoothing (is it necesary? why is the update rate so bad?)
Replace HP Filter with ZDF State variable version

# Bugs for later

Make sure you can't crash the plugin by sending bogus OSC parameters
Warn user if loading preset with missing wavetable.

# Unfinushed features

Filter mode for TrueZero filter
